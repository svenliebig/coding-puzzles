# coding puzzles

some coding puzzles to:

* get me familiar with nvim 
* to get more routine in some programming languages
* get familiar with github/copilot

## create a new directory

you can create daily puzzle directories like this:

```sh
/bin/bash .scripts/create-go.sh
```

## copy a template

if you want to use pre defined test cases and boilerplate code:

```bash
cp -R .templates/go/<template-name>/ <todays-puzzle-dir>
```

## resouces
